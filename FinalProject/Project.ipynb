    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "- The U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underserved youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To date, 25,000 volunteers have created profiles and opted in to receive emails when a career question is a good fit for them. This is where your skills come in. To help students get the advice they need, the team at CareerVillage.org needs to be able to send the right questions to the right volunteers. The notifications sent to volunteers seem to have the greatest impact on how many questions are answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective: develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them."
